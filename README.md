## Description

A server to run Expert Note Taker, an app that saves and deletes notes created by the user. Each new note is given a unique ID and saved to the db.json file which holds all notes. When app is started the server gets previously saved notes from the json and parses them to the app. The user can save new notes or delete unneeded notes, both of which will update db.json.

## Installation Instructions

Install all npm dependencies: type npm i.

Begin by starting nodemon, an extension to automatically restart server: Open terminal and type "npm run devStart". This will get the app running locally on port 3001, so on your browser type: "http://localhost:3001/".

From here the app is running. CLick "Get Started" to go to the note taking page and add or delete any notes.
